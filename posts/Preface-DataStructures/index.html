Importance There are two elementary elements of a program: Data Structures and Algorithms. A data structure affects the functional and structural aspects of our program. Understanding the key properties of data structures and algorithms allows us to use them whenever they are appropriate. A program is a response to a particular problem. Algorithms are computational steps into solving a given problem, while data structures are the structural representation of a problem. Outline of the series In this series, we will discuss data structures by developing one. We will walk through the algorithmic steps into achieving a particular state that we want to maintain in a data structure without formally introducing the design space of algorithms for it deserves a separate discussion on its own. This article will serve as the outline of the series. We follow a consistent format: Introduction - This section will discuss the concepts behind a data structure and its key properties. This will motivate our design goals and implementation. Design goals - In this section, we will flesh out the design requirements of our data structure which we shall satisfy in our implementation section. Implementation - This section translates our design objectives into working code. Testing - This section will translate our design goals into a series of assertions that we test for our working solution. Tradeoffs - This section discusses the cost and benefits of a given data structure. Summary - This section reviews what we had done. Reference - Citation of references made in the article. Throughout the series we will discuss the following data structures: Array-Based - are linear data structures that can be indexed. Array Vector Stack Queue Deque Heap List-Based - are linear data structures that can only be accessed sequentially. Singly Linked List Doubly Linked List Circular Linked List Stack Queue Deque Circular Queue Tree-Based - are non-linear data structures that impose ordering. BST AVL RBT Hash-Based - are non-linear data structures that do not impose order. Hash Map Hash Set Our Language Ideally, this course is language-agnostic. Since I wanted to share with you a peek at implementing data structures, we shall put translate our design goals into an executable programming environment so we can interact with what we built.

Since I wanted to share with you a peek at implementing data structures, we shall put translate our design goals into an executable programming environment so we can interact with what we built. In this series, I will be using C++, but I have included on my <a href="https://github.com/adeeconometrics/Algorithms">GitHub repository</a> on the implementation of data structures in other languages such as Dart, Java, C#, Swift, and Python.</p><h2 id="schedule">Schedule</h2><p>I plan to update this series once a week.</p></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-meta mb-3"> <i class="far fa-folder-open fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href='/categories/programming/'>Programming</a>, <a href='/categories/computer-science/'>Computer Science</a>, <a href='/categories/c/'>C++</a>, <a href='/categories/data-structures/'>Data Structures</a>, <a href='/categories/algorithms/'>Algorithms</a></div><div class="post-tags"> <i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href="/tags/programming/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >programming</a> <a href="/tags/computer-science/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >Computer Science</a> <a href="/tags/c/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >C++</a> <a href="/tags/data-structures/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >Data Structures</a> <a href="/tags/algorithms/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >Algorithms</a></div><div class="post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2"><div class="license-wrapper"> This post is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a> by the author.</div><div class="share-wrapper"> <span class="share-label text-muted mr-1">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Preface: Data Structures - Dave Amiana&url=https://adeeconometrics.github.io//posts/Preface-DataStructures/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Twitter"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-twitter"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=Preface: Data Structures - Dave Amiana&u=https://adeeconometrics.github.io//posts/Preface-DataStructures/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Facebook"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-facebook-square"></i> </a> <a href="https://telegram.me/share?text=Preface: Data Structures - Dave Amiana&url=https://adeeconometrics.github.io//posts/Preface-DataStructures/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Telegram" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Telegram"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-telegram"></i> </a> <i class="fa-fw fas fa-link small" onclick="copyLink()" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Copy link"></i> </span></div></div></div></div></div><div id="panel-wrapper" class="col-xl-3 pl-2 text-muted topbar-down"><div class="access"><div id="access-lastmod" class="post"> <span>Recent Update</span><ul class="post-content pl-0 pb-1 ml-1 mt-2"><li><a href="/posts/On-Pointer-Types/">On Pointer Types</a><li><a href="/posts/Pointers-and-References-Design-Goals-and-Use-Cases/">Pointers and References: Design Goals and Use Cases</a><li><a href="/posts/Unique-Reference/">Unique References</a><li><a href="/posts/Shared-Reference/">Shared References</a><li><a href="/posts/Weak-Reference/">Weak References</a></ul></div><div id="access-tags"> <span>Trending Tags</span><div class="d-flex flex-wrap mt-3 mb-1 mr-3"> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/computer-science/">Computer Science</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/programming/">programming</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/c/">C++</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/data-structures/">Data Structures</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/programming/">Programming</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/algorithms/">Algorithms</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/ownership-semantics/">Ownership Semantics</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/ai/">AI</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/c/">C#</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/java/">Java</a></div></div></div><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/afeld/bootstrap-toc@1.0.1/dist/bootstrap-toc.min.js"></script><div id="toc-wrapper" class="pl-0 pr-4 mb-5"> <span class="pl-3 pt-2 mb-2">Contents</span><nav id="toc" data-toggle="toc"></nav></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-12 col-lg-11 col-xl-8"><div id="post-extend-wrapper" class="pl-1 pr-1 pl-sm-2 pr-sm-2 pl-md-4 pr-md-4"><div id="related-posts" class="mt-5 mb-2 mb-sm-4"><h3 class="pt-2 mt-1 mb-4 ml-1" data-toc-skip>Further Reading</h3><div class="card-deck mb-4"><div class="card"> <a href="/posts/Iterators/"><div class="card-body"> <span class="timeago small" > Aug 28, 2021 <i class="unloaded">2021-08-28T00:00:00+08:00</i> </span><h3 class="pt-0 mt-1 mb-3" data-toc-skip>Iterators: The link between Data Structures and Algorithms</h3><div class="text-muted small"><p> This article will introduce the need for implementing iterators in writing a maintainable and flexible data structure.
